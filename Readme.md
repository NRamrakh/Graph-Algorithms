# Graph Algorithms: Singles-source shortest path algorithm and Minimum Spanning Tree

## Problem 1: Single-source Shortest Path Algorithm
Find the shortest path tree in both directed and undirected weighted graphs for a given source vertex. Assume there is no negative edge in your graph. You will print each path and path cost for a given source.

## Problem 2: Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
